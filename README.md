## Format/Instructions

The technical assessment is composed of two sections; part one will be "take-home" and part two will be done live. For the take-home section, please work through the `tech_assessment` notebook that you just set up in Google Colab. We have additional exercises (related to this notebook) that you will be working through during the live portion.
