# Janus Data Engineering Interview

## Format/Instructions

The Janus Data Engineering technical assessment is composed of two sections; part one will be "take-home" and part two will be done live. Please have part one (take-home) completed to the best of your abilities _prior_ to the technical interview. For the take-home portion, follow the Setup section below and then work through the `tech_assessment` notebook. We have additional exercises (related to this notebook) that you will be working through during the live portion.
